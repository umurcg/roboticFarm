        <blockquote>Plant growth and distribution are limited by the
          environment. If any one environmental factor is less than ideal it
          will become a limiting factor in plant growth. Limiting factors are
          also responsible for the geography of plant distribution. For example,
          only plants adapted to limited amounts of water can live in deserts.
          Most plant problems are caused by environmental stress, either
          directly or indirectly. Therefore, it is important to understand the
          environmental aspects that affect plant growth. These factors are

              The maximum is present in the summer and the minimum in winter.
              The more sunlight a plant receives (up to a point), the better
              capacity it has to produce plant food through photosynthesis. As
              the sunlight quantity decreases the photosynthetic process
              decreases. Light quantity can be decreased in a garden or
              greenhouse by using shade-cloth or shading paint above the plants.
              It can be increased by surrounding plants with white or reflective
              material or supplemental lights.</blockquote></td>

              reaching the plant surface. Sunlight can be broken up by a prism
              into respective colors of red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
              indigo, and violet. On a rainy day, raindrops act as tiny prisms
              and break the sunlight into these colors producing a rainbow. Red
              and blue light have the greatest effect on plant growth. Green
              light is least effective to plants as most plants reflect green 
              light and absorb very little. It is this reflected light that
              makes them appear green. Blue light is primarily responsible for
              vegetative growth or leaf growth. Red light when combined with
              blue light, encourages flowering in plants. Fluorescent or
              cool-white light is high in the blue range of light quality and is
              used to encourage leafy growth. These lights are excellent for
              starting seedlings. Incandescent light is high in the red or
              orange range but generally produces too much heat to be a valuable
              light source. Fluorescent "grow" lights have a mixture
              of red and blue colors that attempts to imitate sunlight as
              closely as possible. They are costly and generally not of any
              greater value than regular fluorescent lights.</blockquote></td>

              the length of periods of light triggered flowering. The various
              categories of response were named according to the light length
              (i.e., short-day and long-day). It was then discovered that it is
              not the length of the light period but the length of uninterrupted
               dark periods that is critical to floral development. The ability
              of many plants to flower is controlled by photoperiod.</blockquote></td>

            <blockquote> Plants can be classified into three categories,
              depending upon their flowering response to the duration of
              darkness. These are short-day, long-day, or day-neutral plants.
              Short-day, (long nights) plants form their flowers only when the
              day length is less than about 12 hours in duration. Short-day
              plants include many spring and fall flowering plants such as
              chrysanthemum and poinsettia. Long-day, (short nights) plants form
               flowers only when day lengths exceed 12 hours. They include
              almost all of the summer-flowering plants, as well as many
              vegetables including beet, radish, lettuce, spinach, and potato.
              Day-neutral plants form flowers regardless of day length. Some
              plants do not really fit into any category but may be responsive
              to combinations of day lengths. The petunia will flower regardless
              of day length, but flowers earlier and more profusely under long
              daylight. Since chrysanthemums flower under the short-day
              conditions of spring or fall the method for manipulating the plant
              into experiencing short days is very simple. If long days are
              predominant, a black plastic sheet is drawn over the chrysanthemum
              for 12 hours daily to block out light until flower buds are
              initiated. To bring a long-day plant into flower when sunlight is
              not present longer than 12 hours artificial light is added until
              flower buds are initiated.</blockquote></td>

              plant depending upon whether the plant variety is a warm-season or
              cool-season crop. If temperatures are high and day length is long,
              cool-season crops such as broccoli and spinach will bolt rather
              than produce the desired flower. Temperatures that are too low or
              high for a warm-season crop will prevent fruit set. Temperatures
              that are too high for warm-season crops such as pepper or tomato
              can cause pollen to become inviable and not pollinate flowers.
              Adverse temperatures also cause stunted growth and poor quality.

              flowering. Daffodils are forced to flower by putting the bulbs in
              cold storage in October at 35° to 40°F (2° to 4°C).
              The cold temperatures allow the bulb to mature. The bulbs are
              transferred to the greenhouse in midwinter where growth begins.

              Photosynthesis slows at low temperatures. Since photosynthesis is
              slowed, growth is slowed and this results in lower yields. Not all
              plants grow best in the same temperature range. For example,
              snapdragons grow best when nighttime temperatures are 55°F (12°C);
              the poinsettia prefers 62°F (17°C). Florist cyclamen does
              well under very cool conditions while many bedding plants prefer a
              higher temperature. Recently it has been found that roses can
              tolerate much lower nighttime temperatures than was previously
              believed. This has meant a conservation in energy for greenhouse
              growers. However, in some cases a certain number of days of low
              temperatures are needed by plants to grow properly. This is true
              of crops growing in cold regions of the country. Peaches are a
              prime example; most varieties require 700 to 1,000 hours below 45°F
              (7°C) and above 32°F (0°C) before they break their
              rest period and begin flowering and growth. If this cold
              requirement is not met then small, misshapen leaves and fruit will
              result. Many times fruit will not set. In low desert areas where
              these temperatures are not experienced low chill peach trees
              should be planted. Lilies need 6 weeks at 33°F (1°C or
              below) before they will bloom.</blockquote></td>
